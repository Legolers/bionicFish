# 🐟 Bionic Fish

**Bionic Fish** is a robotic fish designed to swim in water and **collect microplastics**, helping to protect marine ecosystems. This project was developed by middle school students as part of an educational robotics and environmental innovation challenge.

## 🎯 Project Goals

Microplastic pollution is a serious threat to marine life. Bionic Fish aims to:
- **Remove microplastics** from seawater.
- **Raise awareness** among youth about environmental pollution.
- Promote **hands-on learning** in robotics, programming, and engineering.

## 🔧 Technologies & Materials

- Microcontroller: Arduino Nano ESP32  
- Servo motors and sensors for movement  
- Microplastic collection filter mechanism  
- 3D-printed fish body  
- Programming in Arduino C++

## 🚀 Features

- Autonomous or remote-controlled swimming  
- Microplastic particle collection via internal filtering system  
- Wireless communication for remote control via computer or phone
